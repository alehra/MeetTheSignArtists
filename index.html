		<h1> Meet the Sign Artists</h1>
		<h2>by Alexa Maldonado </h2>
			<h3> Here in Queens, NY, at one of the two Trader Joe's within the borough, there are some amazing sign artists. As an artist myself, I wanted to make something informative about a topic I care about. I'm one of the newest, but I work as one of the few sign artists at the Long Island City Trader Joe's and have come to be fascinated by my work colleagues' process, so I have interviewed them and included some of their work to show the variety of styles. Being able to make these signs is a underappreciated skill, and I wanted to know what goes on the minds of just a handful of the artists at my store. Everyone has a personal touch that they bring to their signage despite the guidelines we have. </h3>
